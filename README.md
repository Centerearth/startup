Change from my development environment!
Change from Github. This is me editing for a conflict.

Gone is the stress you feel every time that you pick classes out for your next semester at BYU. RateMyClass is a RateMyProfessor spinoff that makes the process of choosing easy by giving you all the information you need to make informed decisions. Students who have taken a certain class can post reviews about the difficulty level of the class, professor and TA recommendations, helpful resources, things to watch out for, and really anything else. Students looking to take the class can find the class among a list of all current BYU classes and review the posts made by previous takers to make their BYU stay as smooth as possible.

Key features:

1. Secure login/signup over HTTPS
2. Search bar/dropdown menu to find classes
3. Ability to view recent and dated posts
4. Ability for a user to save posts to find quicker later
5. Posts are stored persistently or archived
6. Ability for students to create posts about classes
7. Ability for admin to create and delete posts
